[Music]  welcome to Carnegie Mellon online for  more multimedia from Carnegie Mellon  University visit WWE  thank you that's very kind but never tip  the waiter before the meal arrives it's  a thank-you Gabe and Jim I couldn't  imagine being more grateful for an  introduction these are two people that  I've known a long long time I taught  here at the University of Virginia I  love this school it's just an incredible  place filled with tradition and history  and respect the kind of qualities that I  really admire that I want to see  preserved in American society and this  is one of the places that I just love  for preserving that I think the honor  code alone at the University of Virginia  just is something that every University  administrator should study and look at  and say you know why can't we do that  too so I think there are a lot of things  about this place to love I'm going to  talk today on the topic of time  management the circumstances are as you  probably know a little bit unusual I  think at this point I'm an authority to  talk about what to do with limited time  my my battle with pancreatic cancer  started about a year and a half ago  thought did all the right things but  it's you know as my oncologist said if  you could pick off a list that's not the  one you'd want to pick so on August 15th  these were my cat scans you can see that  if you scroll through all of them there  were about a dozen tumors in my liver  and the doctors at that time said you  are likely to have three - I love the  way they say it you have three to six  months of good health  left right optimism and positive  phrasing it's sort of like when you're a  Disney what time does the park closed  the park is open until 8:00  so I have three to six months of good  health well let's do the math today is  three months and 12 days so what I had  on my day timer for today was not  necessarily being at the University of  Virginia  I'm pleased to say that we do treat with  palliative chemo they're going to buy me  a little bit of time on the order of a  few months if it continues to work I am  still in perfectly good health with Gabe  of the audience I'm not going to do  push-ups because I'm not going to be  shown up Gabe is really in good shape  but I to be in relatively good health I  had chemotherapy yesterday you should  all try it great but it does sort of beg  the question I have finite time some  people said you know so why are you  going and giving a talk well there a lot  of reasons I'm coming here and giving a  talk one of them is that I said I would  write that's a pretty simple reason and  I'm physically able to another one is  that going to the University of Virginia  is not like going to some far in place  people say aren't you spending all your  time with family and by coming back here  for a day I am spending my time with  family both metaphorically and literally  because it turns out that many of you  have probably seen this picture from the  talk that I gave these are my niece and  nephew Chris and Laura and my niece  Laura is actually a senior a fourth year  here at mr. Jefferson's University so  Laura could you stand up so they see  what you've gotten taller there we go  and I I couldn't be happier to have her  here at this university and the other  the other person so that's Laura the  other person in this picture is Chris  and Chris if you could stand up so they  say you've got much taller and they have  grown in so many ways not just in height  and it's been wonderful to see that and  be an uncle to them is there anybody  here on the faculty or PhD students of  the history department we have any  history people here at all okay anybody  hears from history find Chris right  after the talk because he's currently in  his sophomore year at William and Mary  and he's interested in going into a ph.d  program in history down the road and  there aren't many better PhD programs in  history than this one so so I'm pimping  for my nephew here let's be clear all  right so what are we going to talk about  today we're going to talk about you know  this is not like the lecture that you  may have seen me give before this is a  very pragmatic lecture and one of the  reasons that I had agreed to come back  and give this is because Gabe had told  me that and many other faculty Mears had  told me that they had gotten so much  tangible value about how to get more  done and I truly do believe that time is  the only commodity that matters so this  is a very pragmatic talk and it is  inspirational in a sense it will inspire  you by giving you some concrete things  you might do to be able to get more time  more things done in your finite time so  I'm going to talk specifically about how  to set goals how to avoid wasting time  how to deal with a boss originally this  talk was about how to deal with your  advisor but I've tried to broaden it so  it's not quite so academically focused  and how to delegate to people some  specific skills and tools that I might  recommend to help you get more out of  the day and to deal with the real  problems in our life which are stress  and procrastination I mean if you can  lick that last one you're probably in  good shape and really you don't need to  take any notes so I'll presume if I see  any laptops open you're actually just  you know doing I am or email or  something if you're listening to music  please at least wear headphones I would  always say but all of this will be  posted on my website and just to make it  really easy  if you want to know when to look up any  slides that have a red star on them are  the points that I think you should  really make sure that you you got that  one and conversely if it doesn't have a  red star well so the first thing I want  to say is that Americans are very very  bad at dealing with time as a commodity  we're really good at dealing with money  as a commodity  I mean we're as a culture very  interested in money and how much  somebody earns is a status thing and so  on and so forth but we don't really have  time elevated to that people waste their  time and just always fascinates me and  one of things that I noticed is that  very few people equate time and money  and they're very very equatable so the  first thing I started doing when I was a  teacher was asking my graduate students  well how much is your time worth an hour  or if you work at a company how much is  your time worth to the company what most  people don't realize is that if you have  a salary let's say you make $50,000 a  year it probably costs that company  twice that in order to have you as an  employee because there's heating and  lighting and other staff members on so  forth so if you get paid $50,000 a year  you are costing that company they may  have to raise $100,000 in revenue and if  you divide that by your hourly rate you  begin to get some sense of what you are  worth an hour and when you have to make  trade-offs of should I do something like  write software or should I just buy it  or should I outsource this having in  your head what you cost your  organization an hour is really kind of a  staggering thing to change your behavior  because you start realizing that wow if  I free up 3 hours of my time and I'm  thinking of that in terms of dollars  that's a big savings so start thinking  about your time and your money almost as  if they are the same thing  and of course Ben Franklin knew that a  long time ago so you've got to manage it  and you've got to manage it just like  you manage your money now I realize not  all Americans manage their money that's  what makes the credit card industry  possible and that's and apparently  mortgages too so but most people do at  least understand they don't look at you  funny if you say well can I see your  monetary budget for your household in  fact if I say your household budget you  presume that I'm talking about money  when in fact the household budget I  really want to  about is probably your household time  budget the other team and Technology  Center at Carnegie Mellon students would  come in and during the orientation I  would say this is a master's program  everybody's paying full tuition and it  was roughly thirty thousand dollars a  year and the first thing I would say is  if you're going to come into my office  and say I don't think this is worth  $60,000 a year I will throw you out of  the office I'm not even going to have  that discussion and of course they would  say oh god this couch guy is a real jerk  and then they were right but what I then  followed on with was because the money  is not important you can go and earn  more money later and what you'll never  do is get to two years of your life back  so if you want to come into my office  and talk about the money I'll throw you  out but if you want to come into my  office and say I'm not sure this is a  good place for me to spend two years I  will talk to you all day and all night  because that means we're talking about  the right thing which is your time  because you can't ever get it back a lot  of the advice I'm going to give you  particularly for undergraduates how many  people in this in this room are  undergraduates by show of hands okay  good  still young a lot of this would've done  Hans and Franz and start night live if  you're old enough hear me now but  believe me later right a lot of this is  going to make sense later and one of  nice things as I gave gaybies  volunteered to put this up on the web I  understand that people can actually  watch videos on the web now services so  a lot of this only makes sense later and  when I talk about your boss if you're a  student think about that is your  academic advisor if you're a PhD student  thing about is your PhD advisor and if  you're you know if you're watching this  and you're a young child think of this  as your parent because that's sort of  the person who is in some sense your  boss and the talk goes very fast and I  as I said I'm very big on specific  techniques I'm not really big on  platitudes  I mean platitudes are nice but they  don't really help me get something done  tomorrow the other thing is that one  good thief is worth 10 good scholars and  in fact you can replace the word  scholars in that sentence with almost  anything so almost everything in this  talk is to some degree inspired which is  a fancy fancy way of saying lifted four  from these two books and I found those  books very useful but it's much better  to get them into distilled form so what  I'm basically done is  is collected the nuggets for your bath I  like to talk about the time famine I  think it's a nice phrase does anybody  here feel like they have too much time  okay  nobody excellent and I like the word  famine because it's a little bit like  thinking about Africa I mean you can  airlift all the foods you want in to  solve the crisis this week but the  problem is systemic and you really need  systemic solutions so a time management  solution that says oh I'm going to fix  things for you in the next 24 hours is  laughable just like saying I'm going to  cure hunger in Africa in the next year  you need to think long term and you need  to change fundamental underlying  processes because the problem is  systemic we just have too many things to  do and not enough time to do them the  other thing to remember is it's not just  about time management that sounds like a  kind of a lukewarm you know a talk on  time management that's kind of you know  milquetoast but how about if the talk is  how about not having ulcers right that  catches my attention so a lot of this is  life advice this is how to change the  way you're doing a lot of the things and  how you allocate your time so that you  will lead a happier more wonderful life  and I loved in the introduction that you  talked about fun because if I've brought  fun to academia well it's about damn  time I mean you know if you're not going  to have fun why do it right that's what  I want to know I mean life really is too  short if you're not going to enjoy it  you know people who say well I'm I've  got a job and I don't really like it and  I'm like well you could change oh that  would be a lot of work you're right you  should keep going to work everyday doing  a job you don't like thank you a good  night right so the overall goal is fun  my middle child Logan is is my favorite  example I don't think he knows how to  not have fun now grant a lot of things  he does are not fun for his mother and  me but he's loving every second of it  and he doesn't know how to do anything  that isn't ballistic and full of life  and he's going to keep that quality I  think he's my little Tigger and I always  remember Logan when I think about the  goal is to make sure that you lead your  life you know I want to maximize use of  time but really that's the means not the  end the end is maximizing fun people who  do intense studies  and long people and videotape and so on  and so forth say that the typical office  worker wastes almost two hours a day  all right their desk is messy they can't  find things miss appointments unprepared  for meetings they can't concentrate does  anybody in here by show of hands ever  have any sense that one of these things  is part of their life okay I think we've  got everybody so these are the universal  thing and you shouldn't feel guilty if  some of these things are plaguing you  because they plague all of us they  plagued me for sure and the other thing  I want to tell you is that it sounds a  little cliched and trite but being  successful does not make you manage your  time well managing your time well makes  you successful if I have been successful  in my career I assure you it's not  because I'm smarter than all the other  faculty I mean I'm looking around and  looking at some of my former colleagues  I mean I see Jim Cahoon up there I am  not smarter than Jim Cahoon okay you  know I constantly look around the  faculty places like the University of  Virginia or Carnegie Mellon and I go  damn these are smart people and I snuck  in but what I like to think I'm good at  is the meta skills because if you're  going to have to run with people who are  faster than you you have to like find  the right ways to optimize what skills  you do have so let's talk first about  goals priorities and planning anytime  anything crosses your life you've got to  ask this thing I'm thinking about doing  why am i doing it almost no one that I  know starts with the core principle of  there's this thing on my to-do list why  is it there because if you start asking  well why is I mean again my kids are  great at this that's all I ever hear at  home is why why why right and soon early  we're gonna stop saying why they're just  gonna say okay I'll do it right so ask  why am I doing this what is the goal why  will I succeed at doing it and here's my  favorite what will happen if I don't do  it if I just say yeah I'm just not the  best thing in the world and have  something on my to-do list and I just go  no no one has ever come and taken me to  jail I talked my way out of a speeding  ticket last week it's really cool  it's like the closest I'm ever going to  be to attractive and blonde I told the  guy you know why we had just moved and  so on and so forth and he looked at me  and he said well for a guy who's only  got a couple of months to live you sure  look good and I just pulled up my shirt  to share the scar and I said yeah I look  good on the outside but the tumors are  on the inside he just ran back to his  cruiser and so that's one positive  law-enforcement experience for me so  yeah so the police have never come  because I cross something off my to-do  list and and that's a very powerful  thing because you just got all that time  back the other thing to keep in mind  when you're doing goal-setting  is a lot of people focus on doing things  right I think it's very dangerous to  focus on doing things right I think it's  much more important to do the right  things if you do the right things  adequately that's much more important  than doing the wrong things beautifully  all right doesn't matter how well you  polish the underside of the Bannister  okay and keep that in mind Lou Holtz had  a great list Lou Holtz's 100 things to  do in his life and he would sort of once  a week look at it and say you know if  I'm not working on those 100 things why  was i working on the others and I just  think that's an incredible way to frame  things there's something called the  80/20 rule sometimes you'll hear about  the 90/10 rule but the key thing to  understand is that a very small number  of things in your life or on your to-do  list are going to contribute the vast  majority the veil of the value so if you  have if you're a salesperson 80% of the  revenue is going to come from 20% of  your clients and you better figure out  who those 20% are and spend all of your  time sucking up to them because that's  where the revenue comes so you've got to  really be willing to say this stuff is  what's going to be the value and this  other stuff isn't and you've gotta have  the courage of your convictions to say  and therefore I'm going to shove the  other stuff off of the boat the other  thing you can remember is that  experience comes with time and it's  really really valuable and there are no  shortcuts to getting it so good judgment  comes from experience and experience  comes from bad judgment  so if things aren't going well that  probably means you're learning a lot and  it'll go better later this is by the way  why we pay so much in American Society  for people who are you know typically  older but have done lots of things in  their past because we're paying for  their experience because we know that  experience is one of the things you  can't fake and do not lose the sight do  not lose sight of the power of  inspiration so Randy's in a in an hour  long talk and you know we've already get  our first Disney reference Walt Disney's  quote well does he has many great quotes  what I love is if you can dream it you  can do it and a lot of my cynical  friends say yada yada yada to which I  say shut up all right  inspiration is important and I'll tell  you this much if you I don't know if  Walt was right but I'll tell you this  much if you refuse to allow yourself to  dream it I know you won't do it so the  power of dreams are that they give us a  way to take the first step towards an  accomplishment and Walt was also not  just a dreamer Hult worked really hard  Disneyland this amazes me because I know  a little bit about how hard it is to put  theme park attractions together and they  did the whole original Disneyland Park  in 366 days that's from the first shovel  full of dirt to the first paid admission  right think about how long it takes to  do something say at a State University  by comparison so it's a you know it's  just fascinating when someone once asked  Walt Disney how did you get it done in  366 days he just deadpan we used every  one of them so again there are no short  carts certain short cuts there's a lot  of hard work and anything you want to  accomplish planning is very important  one of the time management cliches is  planning to fail failing to plan is  planning to fail and planning has to be  done at multiple levels I have a plan  every morning when I wake up and I say  what do I need to get done today what I  need to get done this week what do I  need to get done each semester that's  third of the time quanta because I'm an  academic and that doesn't mean you're  locked into it people say yeah but  things are so fluid you know I'm going  to have to change the plan and I'm like  yes you are going to have to change the  plan but you can't change it unless you  have it and the excuse of I'm not going  to make a plan because things might  change is just this paralysis of I don't  have any marching orders so have a plan  acknowledge that you're going to change  it but have it so you have the basis to  start with to-do lists how many people  here right now if I said can you produce  it could show me their to-do list okay  not bad not bad the key thing with to-do  lists is you have to break things down  into small steps I literally once I  might to do this when I was a junior  faculty member at the University of  Virginia  I put get tenure that that was naive and  I looked at that for a while and I said  oh that's really hard I don't think I  can do that and my children Dylan and  Logan and Chloe particularly Dylan is at  the age where he can clean his own Dan  room thank you very much but he doesn't  like to and Chris is smiling because I  used to do this story on him but now I  cut my own kids to pick on but Dylan  will come to me and say I can't pick up  my room it's too much stuff he's not  even a teenager and he's already got  that movie yeah and I say well can you  make your bed yeah I can do that okay  can you put all the clothes in the  hamper yeah I can do that  and you know you do three or four things  and then it's like well Dylan you just  cleaned your room I cleaned my room and  he feels good he is empowered and  everybody's happy and of course I've had  to spend twice as much time managing him  as I could have done it by myself but  that's okay that's what being a boss is  about is growing your people no matter  how small or large they might be at the  time the last thing about to-do lists  are getting yourself going is if you've  got a bunch of things to do do the  ugliest thing first there's an old  saying if you have to eat a frog don't  spend a lot of time looking at it first  and if you have to eat three of them  don't start with the small one  all right this is the most important  slide in the entire talk so if you want  to leave after this slide I will not be  offended because it's all downhill from  here and this is blatantly stolen this  is Steven Covey's great contribution to  the world he talks about it and one in  the seven Habits book it's imagine your  to-do list most people sort their to-do  lists either you know the order that I  got it throw it on the bottom or they  sort it in due date list which is more  sophisticated and more helpful but still  very very raw so looking at the four  quadrant to-do list if you've got a  quadrant where things are important  excuse me and ooh soon important and not  due soon not important and due soon and  not important and not due soon all right  which of these four quadrants do you  think upper left upper right lower left  or right which one do you think you  should work on immediately upper left  you are such a great crowd okay and  which one do you think you should  probably do last lower right and that's  you know that's easy that's obviously  number one that's obviously number four  but this is where everybody in my  experience gets it wrong what we do now  is we say I do the number ones and then  I move on to the stuff that's due soon  and not important when you write it in  this quadrant list it's really stunning  because I've actually seen people do  this and they say okay and this is due  soon and I know it's not important I'm  going to get right to work on it and the  most crucial thing I can teach you about  time management is when you're done  picking off the important and do soon  that's when you go here you go - it's  not due soon and it's important and  there will be a moment in your life  where you say hey this thing that's due  soon but not important I won't do it  because it's not important it says so  right here on the chart  and and magically you have time to work  on the thing that is not due soon but is  important so that next week it never got  a chance to get here because you killed  it in the crib my wife won't like that  metaphor but you kill the or you you you  solve the problem of something that's  due next week when you're not under time  stress because it's not due tomorrow and  suddenly you become one of those  zen-like people who just always seem to  have all the time in the world because  they've figured this out alright  paperwork the first thing you need to  know is that having cluttered paperwork  leads to thrashing you end up with all  these things on your desk and you can't  find anything and the moment you turn to  your desk your desk is saying to you I  own you I have more things than you can  do and there are many colors and laid  out so what I find is that it's really  crucial to keep your desk clear and  we'll talk about where all the paper  goes in a second and you have one thing  on your desk because then it's like ha  now it's Thunderdome me and the one  piece of paper right and so I usually  win that one one of the mantras of time  management is touch each piece of paper  once you get the piece of paper you look  at it you you work at it and I think  that's extremely true for email how many  people here well I'm going to take it  for granted that everybody here has an  email inbox how many people right now  have more than 20 items in their email  inbox oh I'm in the right room your  inbox is not your to-do list and I my  wife has learned that I need to get my  inbox clear now sometimes this really  means just filing things away and  putting something on my to-do list  remember the to-do list is sorted by  importance but my eat does anybody here  have an e mop you have an email program  where you can press the sort by  importance button you know it's amazing  how people who build software that  really is a huge part of our life and  getting work done  and a clue and that's not a slam on any  particular company I think they all have  missed the boat and I just find it  fascinating because everybody I know  where most people I know have this inbox  that I got to ask how many people have  more than 100 things in their email I'm  just not going to go and this is too  depressing  so you really want to get the thing in  your inbox look at it and say I mean  they're going to read it right now or  I'm going to file it and put an entry in  my to-do list and and that's just a  crucial thing because otherwise every  time you go to read your email  you're just swamped and it's just as bad  as the cluttered paper you're all trying  to figure out how that heading goes with  that picture a filing system is  absolutely essential and I know this  because I married the most wonderful  woman in the world  but she's not a good filer but she is  now because after we got married and we  moved in together and we resolved all  the other typical couple things I said  we have to have a place where our papers  go and it's in alphabetical order and  she said that sounds a little compulsive  and I said okay honey so I went out to  Ikea and I got this big nice way too  expensive big wooden fake mahogany thing  with big drawers so she liked it because  it looked kind of kind of nice and  having a place in our house where any  piece of paper went and was in  alphabetical order did wonderful things  for our marriage because there was never  any of this honey where did you put blah  blah blah right and there was never  being mad at somebody because they had  put something in someone ex place there  was an expected place for it and when  you're looking for important receipts or  whatever it is this is actually  important and we have found that this  has been a wonderful thing for us I  think filesystems among groups of people  whether it's a marriage or an office are  crucial but even if it's just you having  a place where you know you put something  really beats all hell out of running  around for an hour going where is it I  know it's blue and I was eating  something when I read it I mean this is  this is not a filing system this is  madness a lot of people ask me so Randy  what is your desk look like so as my  wife would say this is what Randy's desk  looks like when he's photographing it  for a talk the important thing is that  I'm a computer geek so I have the desk  off to the right and then I have a  computer station off to the left I like  to have my desk in front of a window  whenever I can do that this is an old  photograph these have now been replaced  by LCD monitors but I left the old  picture because the crucial thing is it  doesn't matter if they're fancy  high-tech the key thing is screen space  lots of people have studied this how  many people in this room have more than  one monitor on their computer desktop  okay not bad so we're getting there it's  starting to happen what I found is that  I could go back from three to two but I  just can't go back to one there's just  too many things and if somebody said  it's the difference between working on a  desk like at home and trying to get work  done on the little tray on an airplane  in principle the little tray on the  airplane is big enough for everything  you need to do it's just that in  practice it's it's pretty small so  multiple monitors I think are very  important and I'll show you in a second  what I have on each one of those and I  believe in this multiple monitor thing  we believed in it for  long time that's that's my research  group our our laboratory a long time ago  Carnegie Mellon that's Caitlin Kelleher  who's now dr. Kelleher thank you and  she's at Washington University in st.  Louis doing doing wonderful things but  we we had everybody with three monitors  and the cost on this is absolutely  trivial if you figure the cost of adding  a second monitor to an employee's yearly  cost of the company it's not even 1%  anymore so why would you not do it so  one of my walk aways for all of you is  you should all go to your boss and say I  need a second monitor I just can't work  without it Randy told me to tell you  that because it will increase your  productivity and the computers can all  drive two monitors so why not so what do  I have on my three monitors on the left  is my to-do list all sorts of stuff in  there and my system we're all  idiosyncratic my system is that I just  put a number zero through nine and I use  an editor that can quickly sort on that  number in the first column but the key  thing is it's sorted by priority in the  middle is my mail program note the empty  inbox and I try very hard I sleep better  if I go to sleep with the inbox empty  when my inbox does creep up I get really  testy so my wife will actually say to me  I think you need to clear the inbox  on the third one is a calendar that's  this is from a number of years ago but  that's kind of like what my my my days  would be I used to be very heavily  booked and I don't care which software  you use it on which care which calendars  I don't care if it's paper or computer  whatever works for you but you should  have some system whereby you know where  you're supposed to be next Tuesday at 2  o'clock because even if you can live  your life without that you're using up a  lot of your brain to remember all that  and I don't know about you but I don't  have enough brain to spare to use it on  things I can have paper or computers do  for me so back to the overview on the  desk itself let's zoom in a little bit  look I have the one and one thing I'm  working on at the time I have a  speakerphone  this is crucial how many people here  have a speakerphone on their desks ok  not bad but a lot more people don't  speaker phones are essentially free and  I spend a lot of time on hold and that's  because I live in American society where  I get to listen to messages of the forum  your call is extremely important to us  watch while my actions are cognitively  dissonant from my words  you know it's like the worst abusive  relationship in the world  I mean imagine a guy picks you up on the  first day and he smacks you in the mouth  and says I love you honey  that's that's pretty much how modern  customer service works on the telephone  but the great thing about a speakerphone  is you hit the speakerphone and you dial  and then you just do something else and  if it takes seven minutes it takes seven  minutes and hey I just look at this as  somebody's piping music into my office  that's very nice of them I also found  that having a timer on the clock on the  on the phone is handy so that when  somebody finally picks up in Bangalore I  can I I can say things like I'm so glad  to be talking with you by the way if  you're keeping records on this sort of  thing I've been on hold for seven and  half minutes but you don't say it angry  you just say it as I presume you're  logging this kind of stuff and you're  not angry so they don't get angry back  at you but they feel really guilty and  that's good you want guilty right so a  speakerphone is really great I find that  a speakerphone is probably the best  material possession you can buy to  counter stress if I were like teaching a  yoga and meditation class I'd say we'll  do all the yoga meditation I think  that's wonderful stuff but everybody  also has to have a speakerphone what  else do we have besides a speakerphone  let's talk about telephones for a second  I think that the telephone is a great  time-waster and I think it's very  important to keep your business calls  short so I recommend standing during  phone calls great for exercise and if  you tell yourself I'm not going to sit  down until the call is over you'll be  amazed how much brisker you are start by  announcing goals for the call hello sue  this is Randy I'm calling you because I  have three things that I want to get  done boom boom boom  because then you've given her an agenda  and when you're done with the three  things you can say that's great those  are the three things I had it was great  to talk to you I love to talk to you  again bye boom we're off the phone  whatever you do do not put your feet up  I mean if you put the feet up it's just  all over and the other handy trick is  have something on your desk that you  actually are kind of interested in going  to do next  so the phone call instead of being wow I  can get off the phone and go do some  work or I could keep chit-chatting and  usually the person you've called they'd  like to chitchat too  all right so this is where the time  waster in the office goes and if you're  a grad student well if you're a grad  student already know about time wasting  so having something you really want to  do next is a great way to get you off  the phone quicker so you got to train  yourself getting off the phone is hard  for a lot of people I don't suffer from  an abundance of politeness so my sister  who's known me for a long time is  laughing a knowing laugh so when I want  to get off the phone I want to get off  the phone I'm done and what I say is you  know I love to keep talking with you but  I have some students waiting now I'm a  professor somewhere there must be  students waiting right I mean it's got  to be now sometimes you get in a  situation like with a telemarketer all  right and that's awkward because a lot  of people are so polite I have no  trouble with telemarketers I'll just go  there with them and if you're a  telemarketer and you call my house you  have made a mistake yeah I can't talk  right now but once you give me your home  phone number and I'll call you back  around dinnertime Seinfeld did a great  bit on that or or if you want to be a  little bit more over the line I'd love  to talk with you about that but first I  have some things I'd like to sell you  and the funny part is they never realize  you're yanking with them that's but if  you have to hang up on a telemarketer  what you do is you hang up while you're  talking well I think that's really  interesting and I would love to keep  I mean talk about self-effacing hanging  up on yourself and they won't figure it  out if they do and they call back just  don't answer right so a ten years from  now all anybody will remember from this  talk is hang up on yourself the other  thing is group your phone calls call  people right before lunch or right  before the end of the day because then  they have something they would rather do  than keep shitty chatting with you so I  find that calling somebody at 11:50 is a  great way to have a ten-minute phone  call because frankly you may think  you're interesting but you are not more  interesting than lunch I have become  very obsessive about phones and using  time productively so I I just think that  everybody should have something like  this I don't care about fashion so you  know I don't have Bluetooth and you know  I have this big ugly thing hi I'm Julie  from time-life right but the thing this  allows me to do because you know I am  sort of living the limit case right now  I've I've got to get stuff done and I  really don't have a lot of time so I get  an hour a day where I exercise on my  bike and this is me on my bike and if  you look carefully you can see I'm  wearing that headset I've got my cell  phone and for an hour a day I ride my  bike around the neighborhood this is  time that I'm spending on the phone  getting work done and it's not a moment  being taken away from my wife or my  children and it turns out that I can  talk and ride a bike at the same time  amazing the skill sets I have so it  works better in cold weather climate in  warm weather climates but I have just  found that having a headset frees me up  even it's just around the house you wear  a headset you can fold laundry it's an  absolute twofer and I just think  telephones should have headsets and  someday we will all have the Borg  implant and it will be a non-issue what  else is on my desk I have sort of one of  those address stampers because I got  tired of writing my address I have a box  of Kleenex in your box at work if you're  a faculty member you have to have a box  of Kleenex because it  Jim is laughing right you know at least  if you teach the way I do  there will be crying students in your  office and what I found to diffuse a lot  of that is that I would have cs3 52 or  whatever written on the side of the  Kleenex box and I would turn it as I  handed it to them and they would take  the Kleenex and it would be like oh I  said yeah yeah you know it's for the  class you're not alone so having Kleenex  is very important and thank-you cards  I'll now ask the embarrassment question  and I don't mean to pick on you but it  just points things out so well by show  of hands who here has written a  thank-you note that is not a quid pro  quo I don't mean oh you gave me a gift I  wrote you a thank-you note and I mean a  physical thank-you note with a pen and  ink and paper not not email because  email is better than nothing but it's  that much better than nothing okay how  many people here have written a  thank-you note in the last week not bad  I do better here than at most places  because it is UVA chivalry is not dead  but that's how many people in the last  month how many people in the last year  the fact that there are a non-trivial  number of hands not up for the year  means that anybody who's in this  audience as parents are going that was  my kid thank you notes are really  important there they're a very tangible  way to tell someone how much you  appreciated things I have thank you  notes with me and that's because I'm  actually writing some later today to  some people who've done some nice things  for me recently and you say well God you  have time for that I'm like yes I have  time for that because it's important  even in my current status I will make  time to write thank-you notes to people  and even if you're a crafty weaselly  bastard you should still write thank-you  notes  because it makes you so rare that when  someone gets a thank-you note they will  remember you right it seems like the  only place that thank-you notes are  really taken seriously anymore is when  people interviewing for jobs they now  sometimes write thank-you notes to the  recruiters which I guess shows a sign of  desperation on the part of the recent  graduates but thank-you notes are a  wonderful thing and I would encourage  all of you to go out and buy a stack at  your local dime store and have them on  your desk so that when the moment seizes  you it's right there and I leave my  thank-you notes out on the desk readily  accessible and as I've said before  gratitude is something can go beyond  cards when I got tenure here I took my  whole research team down to Disneyworld  on my nickel for a week and I just I  believe in large gestures but you know  it's also a lot of fun I wanted to go to  write I didn't send them without proper  chaperoning after all what else I have a  paper recycling bin and this is very  good because it helps save the planet  but it also helps save my butt so when I  have a piece of paper that I would be  throwing away I put it in that bin and  that takes I don't know a couple of  weeks to to get filled up and then  actually send somewhere else and so what  I've really done here is I've created  sort of the Windows Macintosh  trashcan you can pull stuff back out of  it works in the real world too  and about once a month I go ferreting  through there to find the receipt that I  didn't think I'd ever need again that I  suddenly need and it's extremely handy I  suspect that if I were giving this talk  in 10 years I would say I just put it in  the auto scanner right because I find it  almost inconceivable that 10 years from  now first off that a lot of the stuff  would be paper in my hands anyway but if  it were paper that I would have any  notion of doing anything other than  putting it on the desk where it goes it  and it's already scanned because it  touched the desk right you know this  kind of stuff is not really hard to do  so I think that's what's going to happen  and of course I have a phone book  notepad I can't live without post-it  notes all right I mean  and the view out the window of the dog  because the dog reminds me that I should  be out playing with him we have we had  the when I got married I married into a  family I got a wife and two beautiful  dogs there's the other one could you  help me with the debate I've had with my  wife by show of hands how many people  would semantically say the dog is on the  couch  nobody thank you thank you because the  dog was not allowed on the couch and my  wife came in one day and anyway thank  you for agreeing with me it makes me  feel very good so the dog is wonderful  the dogs have long gone on but they are  still in our hearts and our memories and  and I think of them every day  and they're they're just they're still a  part of my life  I've presented to you how I do my office  how I do things it's not the only way  one of the best assistants I've ever met  was a woman named Tina Cobb and she has  a really different system she's a  spreader all right if you think about it  there's a method to her madness  everything here is exactly one arms  radius from where she sits you know it's  it's like a two-armed octopus and she  got so much stuff done and I never  presumed to tell somebody else how to  change their system if their system is  working tina was much more efficient  than i was so you know i would just say  look do what works for you and everybody  has to find the system for themselves  but you really got to think about what  makes me more efficient now let's talk  about office logistics in most office  settings people come into each other's  offices and proceed to suck the life out  of each other  if you have a big cushy chair in your  office you might as well just slather  butter all over yourself and send  yourself naked into the woods for the  wild animals to attack you I say make  your office comfortable for you and  optionally comfortable for others  so no comfy chairs I used to have  folding chairs in my office  fold it up against the wall so people  want to come in to me and talk with me  they can stand and I would stand up  because then the meetings going to be  really fast because we want to sit down  but then if it looks like it's something  we should have a little more time on I  very graciously go over and open the  folding chair I'm such a gentleman some  people do a different tack on this they  have the chair already there but they  cut two inches off the front leg so the  whole time you're in their office you're  sort of scooting yourself up I'm not  advocating that but I thought it was  damn clever the first time I saw it  scheduling yourself verbs are important  you do not find time for important  things you make it and you make time by  electing not to do something else  there's a term from economics that  everybody should hold near and dear to  that heart and that term is opportunity  cost the bad thing about doing something  that isn't very valuable it's not that  it's a bad thing to have done it the  problem is that once you spend an hour  doing it that's an hour you can never  again spend in any other way and that's  important now how do you keep these  unimportant things from sucking into  your life you learn to say no it's great  my my youngest child Chloe is at an age  where this is her new word about two  weeks ago she learned it and it's like  now everything's no no no no no no she  should be giving this talk and I asked  her and she said no  so she's how I'm playing all right but  we all hate to say no because people ask  us for help and we want to be gracious  so let me teach you some gentle nose the  first one is I'll do it if I'm really  strapped but I want to help you I don't  want you to be in the bind so if nobody  else steps forward I will do this for  you all right  or I'll be your deep fallback but you  have to keep searching for somebody else  now you will find out about the person's  character at that moment because if they  say great I got my sucker and they  stopped looking then they have abused a  relationship but if they say that's  great my stress level is down at zero  because now I know it's not going to be  a disaster but I'm going to keep looking  for somebody for whom it's less of an  imposition  that's a person that will get lots of  this sort of support okay when I was in  graduate school we did a moving party  with four people a lot of moving parties  carry heavy objects we had four people  we should have had 12 it was a long day  and after that I stopped there new  policy I said from now on when somebody  says will you help me move I'll say how  much stuff you got and they would tell  me I'd say whom that sounds like about  eight people if you give me the names of  seven other people that will be there  I'll be there and I never again was at a  moving party that went for 14 hours in  January in Pittsburgh everybody has good  and bad times a big thing about time  management is find your creative time  and defend it ruthlessly spend it alone  maybe at home if you have to but defend  it ruthlessly the other thing is find  your dead time schedule meetings phone  calls exercise mundane stuff but do  stuff during that where you don't need  to be at your best and we all have these  times and the times are not at all  intuitive I discovered that my most  productive time was between 10:00 p.m.  and midnight which is really weird but  it's sort of this for me it's just this  burst of energy right before the end  let's talk about interruptions an  interruption there are people who  measure this kind of stuff who have stop  watches and clipboards and what they say  is that an interruption takes typically  six to nine minutes but then there's a  four to five minute recovery to get your  head back into what you're doing and if  you're doing something like software  creation you may never get your head  back there the cost can be infinity but  if you do the math on that five  interruptions blows a whole hour so  you've got to find ways to reduce both  the frequency and the length of these  interruptions one of my favorites is  turn phone calls into email if you phone  my office at Carnegie Mellon it says hi  this is Randy please send me email again  I presume everybody here has email how  many people here when a new message  comes in does your computer go ding or  make some other noise we still have  people doing that what the heck is wrong  with you people and I love the fact that  computer scientists just know nothing  about anything so for years by default  all these packages out of the box would  go ding every time you get a new piece  of email so we had taken a technology  explicitly designed to reduce  interruption and we'd turn them into  interruptions  so you just got to turn that off whole  point of email is you go to it when  you're ready not you're sitting around  like Pavlov's dog saying oh maybe I'll  get another email in the same way you  try to not interrupt other people I save  stuff up so I have boxes for Tina or for  my research group meeting and I put  stuff in those boxes and then once a  week or however often when the box gets  full I walk down the hall and I  interrupt that person one time and say  here are the eight things I have for you  how do you cut things short because  people always want to spend more time  than you want to spend you can say look  somebody interrupts you and says you  know got a few minutes and say well I'm  in the middle of something right now and  that tells them I'm interrupting it I'm  going to do it quickly but I got to get  back to that or you can say I only have  5 minutes the great thing about that is  that later you have the privilege of  extending that if you so choose but when  the five minutes are up you can say well  I said at the beginning I had five  minutes and I really have to go now so  it's a very socially polite way to bound  the amount of time on the interaction if  somebody's in your office and they don't  get it now I'm not saying it as a  computer scientist I have an inordinate  amount of time to interact the  opportunity to interact with people with  no social skills  mm but if you have someone in your  office who is just not getting it what  you do is you stand up you walk to the  door you complement them for some reason  this is a crucial part of the process  you thank them and you shake their hand  and if they still don't leave which is  pretty much a guarantee that you're  dealing with someone from my tribe then  you're in the doorway you just keep  going what I have found is that people  don't like it when you look at your  watch while you're talking with them so  what I do is I put a wall on the clock  right behind them so it's just off axis  from their eyes and I can just kind of  glance over a little bit when I need to  see what time it is it's a very nice way  to get me information without being rude  to them time Journal's time is the  commodity you better find out where your  time is going so monitor yourself and  update it throughout the day you can't  wait till the end of the day and say  what was I doing at 10:30 because our  memories aren't that good so what you do  and I really hope that technology within  you know another five years or so will  be so good that the time journals can be  created automatically or at least some  facsimile of it but until then what we  do is we monitor it ourselves so this is  what an empty time journal would look  like the details aren't important but  the key thing is that when you fill it  in you've got a bunch of categories and  what I was doing and you can do this  very informally but you get a lot of  real data about where your time went and  it's always very different anybody who's  done monetary budgeting you look at me  go wow I didn't know I was spending that  much on dry-cleaning or restaurants  would it's always a fascinating surprise  and you always spend more than you think  but with time budgets you find out that  the time is just going wildly  differently than you would have imagined  the best example of this I know is a  Turing Award winner Fred Brooks is time  clocks he's a brilliant computer  scientist but he also has this great  array of clocks in his office and when  you go in and talk to him he says is  this meeting about research or teaching  or whatever and then he flips the  appropriate switch at the end of the  week he knows exactly where his time  went  a man is a genius when when I meet with  students and this is I think Jetts it's  appropriate for people in the workplace  I say what's your schedule you have a  set of fixed meetings every every time  every week and what you have to do is  you have to look at those and identify  the the open blocks where you're going  to waste time and I can tell your waste  time just by looking at it so in this  case you've got a class where you've got  a class at a certain point and then  you've got a gap until the next class so  I've identified those here and the gaps  between classes that in this case lasts  an hour or an hour and a half this is  just prime time to be wasted so what I  always taught my students was make up a  fake class the fake class is go to one  specific place in the library during  that hour and when you're sitting there  with just you in the library and your  books there's a pretty good chance you  might actually study so don't go and  hang out with friends for an hour just  make that a fake class make your own  little study hall it's a simple trick  but it's amazing how effective it is  when somebody just explicitly does it  when you've got your time Journal data  what do you figure out from that what am  i doing that doesn't need to be done  what can someone else do I love everyday  sort of saying what am I doing that I  could delegate to somebody else  my sister is again laughing because she  knows who that person was in our youth  what can I do more efficiently and how  am I wasting other people's time when  you get good at time management you  realize that it's a collaborative thing  I want to make everybody more efficient  it's not a selfish thing it's not me  against you it's how do we all  collectively get more done as you push  on the time journal stuff you start to  find that you don't make yourself more  efficient at work so you can become some  sort of uber worker person you become  more efficient at works so you can leave  at 5:00 and go home and be with the  people that you love people call this  work-life balance for the junior faculty  you may have heard of it in some sort of  mythical sense but it is it is possible  I found that I worked less I work fewer  hours after I got married and I got more  done and I was always fascinated in  graduate school that the people who  graduated  with their PhDs were the people who had  a spouse and kids so how can that be  that's like a built in boat anger  alright  you know you got all these other demands  on your time and I'm like a single guy  and I got all the time in the world and  that's the problem I approach it like I  got all the time in the world so my time  isn't precious when you've got a spouse  and little kids your spouse is likely to  say things to you like you better not be  in at that grad school more than 40  hours a week so when you come in you're  not sitting around playing computer  games not that I ever did that but when  you come in you're coming in and you're  doing work and I found like most people  that once I got married and had kids my  whole view of time management really got  I mean we were playing for real stakes  now because now there are people whose  lives are impacted if I'm spending too  much time at work the other thing about  time management it makes you really  start to look through a crystalline lens  and figure out what's important and  what's not I love this picture I've  blanked out her name but this says blah  blah blah blah blah  words as a pregnant woman and it says  she is worrying about the effect on her  unborn child from the sound of  jackhammers so they're doing  construction and the people here are  laughing because they can see that this  woman who's so concerned about the  jackhammers affecting her unborn child  is holding a lit cigarette you got to  get really good at saying I got to focus  my time and energy on the things that  matter and not worry about the things  that don't know I'm not a medical doctor  and I don't play one on TV but I'm  willing to bet that if I were the fetus  I'd be saying put the cigarette out mom  I can deal with the noise alrighty so in  terms of I want to take a little story  about effective versus efficient I  actually was going to give this talk a  couple of weeks ago and I talked with  game about it and we were going to come  up here because as a surprise for my  wife her favorite musical group in the  whole world is the police and has been  for a long long time  they're a wonderful group and so we said  hey we're going to drive up to  Charlottesville and see them we managed  to get some tickets and I said well  honey well as long as we're up there I  promise Gabe a long time ago I wanted to  give my time management talk and she  said okay because it's about a  three-hour drive so it's very efficient  to couple these two trips together and  about two days later she said you know  honey I know how you are with talks and  before you give one for a couple of days  you start to  and and as we talked through it she said  so we're going to go up in this couples  time away we got a sitter to watch the  kids and this couples time away is going  to be eaten up by you obsessing over  preparing this talk and I thought about  it I said okay so obviously the right  solution is we should keep our couples  time our couples time we'll go up we'll  see the concert you know we'll have our  time together and I'll just schedule a  different day and I'll go up on a one  day trip and I'll do the talk and she  said wow that was easy  and I write once you frame it in the  right way and you say yeah the cost here  is that I have to do the drive a second  time but it turns out I'm doing the  drive with my nephew Christopher and we  talked and my mom was turns out so the  time wasn't even dead time so there was  no loss at all but the key thing was we  said it's not about efficiency it's  about effectiveness and best overall  outcome and of course one of the nice  things was that we did get to go to the  police concert and I really want to  thank gaben and Jim mailer because we  really went to the concert and my wife  was very happy I'm the guy in the back  saying she's not paying any attention to  me today but it but it was wonderful and  he is a charming gentleman in person he  is absolutely charming  so let's talk about procrastination  there's an old saying procrastination is  the thief of time procrastination is  hard and I have a little bit of an  insight here for you we don't usually  procrastinate because we're lazy  sometimes people rationalize their  procrastination they say well gee if I  wait long enough maybe I won't have to  do it right that's true sometimes you  get lucky all right but and other people  say gee if I start on it now I'm just  going to spend all the time on it if I  only if I only give myself the last two  days I'll do it in two days because  that's the work expands to fill the time  available Parkinson's law that's  marginally true but I think the key  balance here is to understand that doing  things at the last minute is really  expensive and it's just much more  expensive than doing it just before the  last minute so if you're doing something  and you can still mail it through the  u.s. mail you have suddenly avoided that  oh my god I've got to do the whole fax  thing now I love FedEx FedEx supports  our whole  Universal habit of procrastination but  it also allows us to get stuff there  when it really has to be there in a  hurry so that's a wonderful thing but I  think you have to you have to realize  that if you push things right up to the  deadline that's where all the stress  comes from because now you can't reach  people if somebody is out of the office  for just one day your whole plan is  upset so you really have to work hard on  this kind of stuff the other things that  deadlines are really important we are  all essentially deadlines driven so if  you have something that isn't due for a  long time  make up a fake deadline and act like  it's real and that's wonderful because  those are the deadlines when push comes  to shove you can slip them by a couple  of days and it's alright  so they're less stressful if you are  procrastinating you've got to find some  way to get back into your comfort zone  identify why you're not enthusiastic  whenever I procrastinate on something  there's always a deep psychological  reason usually it's I'm afraid of being  embarrassed because I don't think I'll  do it well or I'm afraid I'm going to  fail at it and sometimes it involves  asking somebody for something and one of  the most magical things I've learned in  my life is that sometimes you just have  to ask and wonderful things happen but  you just have to you know step out and  do that I I won the parent lottery I  have just wonderful parents and my dad  unfortunately passed away not too long  ago but there's one of my favorite  photographs because my dad was such a  smart guy I could almost never surprise  him or impress him  because he was just that good but we  were down on a family vacation at Disney  World and the monorail were going by and  we're going to board the monorail and we  noticed that in the in the front up here  in the cabin on earth you can see in  this picture but there's an engineer who  drives the monorail and there actually  guessed something there with him which  is kind of unusual my dad and I were  talking about that and I knew because  I've done some consulting for Disney my  dad saying oh they probably have to be  special VIPs or something I thought I  said oh there is a trick there is a  special way you get into that cabin and  he said really what is it I said I'll  show you Dylan come with me and Dylan  who's who's the back of his head you can  see there we walk up and I whispered to  Dylan ask the man if we can ride in the  front and we go to the attendant in the  attendant says why yes you can and he  opens the gate and my dad is just like  I said I told you there was a trick I  didn't say it was hard and sometimes all  you have to do is ask and it's that easy  let's talk about delegation nobody  operates individually anymore and you  can accomplish a lot more when you have  help however most people delegate very  poorly they treat delegation is dumping  I don't have time to do this you take  care of it you know and then they  micromanage and it's just a disaster the  first thing if you're going to delegate  something to a subordinate is you grant  them authority with responsibility you  don't tell somebody go take care of this  but if you need to spend any money  you've got to come back to me for  approval ah that's not empowering them  that's telling them you don't trust them  if I trust you enough to do the work I  trust you enough to give you the  resources and the budget and the time  and whatever else you need to get it  done you give them the whole package the  other thing is delegate but always do  the ugliest job yourself so when we need  to vacuum the lab before a demo I bring  in the vacuum cleaner and I vacuum it  alright do the dirtiest job yourself so  it's very clear that you're willing to  still get the dirt on your hands treat  your people well people are the greatest  resource and if you are fortunate enough  to have people who report to you treat  them with dignity respect and you know  to sound a little bit corny the kind of  love that they should have from someone  who cares about them in their  professional development and for crying  out loud staff and secretaries are your  lifeline all right if you don't think  you should treat them well because it's  a decent thing to do at least treat them  well because if you don't they will get  you right and they will get you good and  you will deserve it and I will applaud  them by giving a talk on time management  with Alf Weaver in the audience where is  elf there he is that's like talking  about surviving the Jonestown flood if  Noah's in the audience one of things  that Alf Weaver taught me is whether  it's to a colleague or to a subordinate  if you want to get something done you  cannot be vague and he said you give  somebody a specific thing to do a  specific date and time Thursday is not a  specific time Thursday at 3:22 gets  somebody's attention and you give them a  specific penalty or reward that will  happen if that deadline for that thing  is not met  and then he paused he said and remember  the penalty reward has to be for them  not you right I won't be screwed over if  you meet that deadline Oh  bummer right this is an important point  to not get wrong challenge people I've  been told that one of the tricks is you  delegate until they complain I don't  know buddy till they complain but what I  found is that under delegation is a  problem people are usually yearning for  the opportunity to do more they want to  be challenged they want to prove to you  and themselves they can be more capable  so let them communication has to be  clear so many times people get upset  with their bosses because there's a  misunderstanding and particularly in a  time of email it's so easy to  communicate via email even if you've had  a face-to-face conversation send a  two-line email just to be specific  afterwards and it's not like we're  trying to be all lawyer like it's just  that as judge Wapner said get it in  writing if you remember the People's  Court and judge Wapner said if there  isn't a problem it's not a problem it  didn't take you much time but if there  ever is a problem well wait a second  there won't be a problem because there's  a written record and that's the magic  there won't be a confusion because you  can't disagree about the written word  don't give people how you want them do  it tell them what you want them to do  give them objectives not procedures let  them surprise you with a way of solving  a problem you would never have imagined  sometimes those solutions are mind  blowing good or bad but they're really  much more fun than just having them do  it the way you would have done it and  you know what if you're in a university  your job should be to have people  smarter than you  ie your students and they will come up  with stuff you would never have thought  of the other thing is tell people the  relative importance of each task I mean  so many people say oh my boss is an ogre  they gave me five things to do I'm like  what do they tell you which one was the  most important oh yeah mmm I guess I  could ask that knowing that if you have  five things which are the ones to get  done is really important because if  you're flying blind you've got a 20  percent chance of getting them done in  the right order and delegation can never  be done to you  does everyone see the difference in the  two pictures this is my daughter Chloe I  love her to death but I want her to grow  up to be a wonderful person and I know  the sooner she holds her own bottle the  better sociology beware upward  delegation sometimes you try to delegate  and people try to hand it back to you  one of the best things I ever saw was  someone who had a secretary trying to  say I can't do this you'll have to take  it back and he just put his hands behind  his back and took a step backwards and  then he waited and then eventually the  secretary said or maybe I could find  this other solution and he said that's  wonderful I'm so proud you thought of  that right it was just it was an elegant  gesture reinforced behavior won't repeat  in one of my favorite stories in the one  minute manager as he talked about did  you ever wonder how they got the killer  whales to jump through the hoop if they  did it like modern American office  managers they would yell at the killer  whale jump through the hoop and every  time the killer whale didn't jump  through the hoop they'd hit it with a  stick right I mean this is how we train  people in the office place read the book  if you want to see how they actually do  it because I'm curious I know now but  it's really cool how they do get them to  do it  so reinforced behavior one repeated when  people do things that you like praise  them and thank them that's worth more  than any amount of monetary reward or a  little plaque people really like to just  be told straight up thank you I really  appreciate that you did a good job the  other thing is that if you don't want  things delegated back up to you don't  learn how to do them I take great pride  I don't know how to run photo copiers  and fax machines and I ain't going to  learn that's certainly now I'm not going  to spend my remaining time meetings the  average executive spends more than 40%  of his or her time in a meeting my  advice is when you have a meeting lock  the door unplug the phone and take  everybody's BlackBerry's because if it's  worth our time it's worth our time if  it's not worth our time it's not worth  our time but I don't have any interest  in being in a room with six people who  are all half there because that's very  inefficient  I don't think meeting should ever last  more than an hour with very rare  exception and I think that there should  be an agenda I got into a great habit a  couple years ago and I just started  saying it's a no agenda I won't  and the great thing about that is  whoever called the meeting had to  actually think before they showed up  about why we were supposed to be there  because otherwise it's like well why are  we here because we had a meeting it's on  all of our calendars it's it's just a  classic Dilbert moment so most important  thing about meetings and again this this  comes from the one minute manager  one minute minutes at the end of a  meeting somebody has to have been  assigned to the scribe and they write  down in one minute or less what  decisions got made and who is  responsible for what by when and then  they email it out to everybody because  if you don't do that you have your next  weekly meeting next week and you all sit  around going now who is going to do this  right it's very inefficient and it's so  fast to just do these one-minute minutes  let's talk about technology people I'm a  computer scientist so they say which  gadget will make me more time efficient  and I don't have an answer for that it's  all idiosyncratic but I will tell you  that my favorite comment about  technology comes from a janitor at the  University of Central Florida who said  computers are faster they just take  longer that's Zen right there so that's  another way of saying only use  technology that's worth it and worth it  is end to end did it make me more  efficient and that depends on how you  work and we're all different and  remember that technology is getting  insane I walked into McDonald's and I  ordered you know happy meal number two  and they said would you like a cell  phone with that I went to the grocery  store to buy 16 slices of American  cheese and you get growl yours  encyclopedia so with 16 slices of cheese  you get all of man's knowledge for free  that's just spooky scary and remember  that technology really has to be  something that makes your life better  you guys may have seen this I just find  it very humorous  so only use technology that helps you I  find the technology is good if it allows  you to do things in a new way just doing  the same things a little bit faster with  technology is nice but when technology  changes the workflow so I was carving  pumpkins a few years ago and this is FM  a good friend of mine and you don't know  if you can see it but down by her right  knee is a pattern and you lay this  pattern over the pumpkin and get this  little special carving knife and you can  instead of these amateurish pumpkins  like I made you get this sort of howling  at the moon and her husband Jeff and I  thought this was really cool but inside  of a reactionary Burning Man kind of a  moment we grabbed our power drills and  we carved our pumpkins that way use  technology if it changes the way you do  things because you get and believe me  the results of a power drill you get  these little oh it's just gorgeous let's  talk briefly about email because email  is such a large part of all our lives  first off don't ever delete any of it  save all of it I started doing this 10  years ago all right an interesting thing  is that all the historians talk about oh  it's such a shame we don't have people  keeping Diaries we don't know what their  day is like I'm like you fools we have  just entered a society circa about ten  years ago and I'm a living example of it  every piece of my correspondence is not  only saved it's searchable so if I were  you know a person of merit a historian  which is a big stretch the historian  could actually look at my patterns of  communication much better than the most  compulsive diary writer now we could  talk about whether or not I'm being in  for full you know introspective that's  that's about content but in terms of  quantity it's great and of course you  can save your email and you can search  it and it's just wonderful because you  can pull back stuff from five years ago  so never delete your email here's a big  email trick if you want to get something  done do not send the email to five  people hey could somebody take care of  this every one of those five recipients  is thinking one and only one thing I  deleted it first  all right so the other four people will  take care of this I don't have to so you  send it to one and only one person but  if you really want it to be done send it  to somebody who can do it tell them  what's again Alf Weaver specific things  specific time and then these the penalty  can be more subtle like you just see see  there boss alright and the other thing  I've had to teach I had this  conversation with every student in my  entire career because they send email  and then they just wait for the person  to respond and I say if the person is  not responded within 48 hours it's okay  to nag them and the reason it's okay to  nag them because if they haven't  responded within 48 hours the chance  that they are ever going to respond is  zero what I mean maybe not zero  maybe that small but in my experience if  people don't respond you within 48 hours  you'll probably never hear from them so  just start nagging them let's talk about  the care and feeding of bosses there's a  phrase managing from beneath because we  all know that all bosses are idiots  that's certainly the expression you know  the offense the sense I've gotten from  everybody who has a boss when you have a  boss write things down and do that clear  communication thing ask them when is our  next meeting what do you want me to have  done by then so you've got sort of a  contract who can I turn to for help  besides you because I want to bother you  and remember your boss wants a result  not an excuse general advice on  vacations phone callers should get two  options the first one is when you're on  vacation the first option is contact  John Smith not me I'm out of the office  but this person can help you now if it's  urgent or call back when I'm back why  because you don't want to come back to a  long sequence of phone messages saying  you know hey Randy can you help me get  care of this and you call him back and  you know you've been on vacation for a  week they already solved it and the  other thing is that it's not a vacation  if you're reading email all right trust  me on that it's not a vacation if you're  reading email I can stay in my house all  weekend and not read email and it's a  vacation  but if I go to Hawaii and I've got a  blackberry I'm not on vacation and I  know this when I got married my wife and  I got married we left our reception in a  hot-air balloon which did not have  wireless on it and  Dean Jim Morris at the time we took a  month-long honeymoon which was great but  not really long enough and Jim Morris  said and I said I'm not going to be  reachable for a month and Jim said  that's not acceptable so what do you  mean it's not acceptable he said well I  pay you so that's the not acceptable and  I said oh okay there and I said there so  there has to be a way to reach me he  said yes I said okay so if you called my  office there would be a phone answering  machine message that said hi this is  Randy I'm on vacation  I waited till 39 to get married and so  we're going for a month and I hope you  have a problem with that but apparently  my boss does so he says I have to be  reachable so here's how you can reach me  my wife's parents live in blah blah blah  town here's their names if you call  directory assistance you can get their  number and then if you can convince my  new in-laws that your emergency merits  interrupting their only daughter's  honeymoon they have our number here's  some of my most important advice we  close with some of the best stuff kill  your television people who study this  say the average American watches 28  hours of television a week that's almost  3/4 of a full-time job so if you really  want to get time back in your life you  don't have to kill your television but  just unplug it put it in the closet and  put a blanket over it see how long it  takes you to get the shakes turn money  into time especially junior faculty  members or other people who have young  children this is the time to throw money  at the problem  hire somebody else to mow your lawn do  whatever you need to do but exchange  time for exchange money for time at  every opportunity when you have very  young children because you just don't  have enough time it's just too hard and  the other thing is eat and sleep and  exercise above all else you always have  time to sleep because if you get  sleep-deprived  everything falls apart other general  advice never break a promise but  renegotiate them if need be if you've  said I'll have this done by Tuesday at  noon you can call the person on Friday  and say I'm still good to my word but  I'm really jacked up and I'm going to  have to stay and work over the weekend  to meet that Tuesday deadline is there  any way there's any slack on that and a  lot of times they'll say Thursdays  fine because I really need it Thursday  but I told you Tuesday or they'll say oh  it's no problem I can have Jim do that  instead of you he has some free time now  if they say no I there's no wiggle room  here you say that's okay no problem I'm  still good to my work all right if you  haven't got time to write it do it right  you don't have time to do it wrong  that's self-evident recognize that most  things are pass/fail people spend way  too much time there's a reason we have  the expression good enough it's because  the thing is good enough and the last  thing is get feedbacks loops ask people  in confidence because if someone will  tell you what you're doing right or  doing wrong and they'll tell you the  truth that's worth more than anything  else in the whole world I recommend  these two books time management is not a  late-breaking field both these books are  old books but I recommend them highly  and it's traditional to close a talk  like with this like this with here's the  things I told you about I'm not going to  tell you the things I told you about I'm  going to tell you the things that you  can operationally go out and do today  first thing if you don't have a day  timer or a personal digital assistant  you know a Palm Pilot or ever go get one  put your to-do list in priority order  you can use the four quadrants or do  what I do just put a number zero 9 but  sorted by priority and do a time journal  if that's really too much effort just  count the number of hours you watch of  television in the next week that's my  gift to you and the last thing is once  you've got your day-timer make a note  for 30 days from today it's okay if that  one goes ding to remind you and revisit  this talk in 30 days it'll be up on the  web courtesy of Gabe and ask what have I  changed and if I haven't changed  anything then we still had a pleasant  hour together if you have changed things  then you'll probably have a lot more  time to spend with the ones you love and  that's important time is all we have and  you may find one day you have less than  you think  thank you  you
